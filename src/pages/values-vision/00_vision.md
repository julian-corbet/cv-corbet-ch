Leading strategic consultancies (McKinsey, BCG, Bain), alongside firms like Accenture and Deloitte, converge on a powerful narrative: AI is maturing from a support tool toward <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">agentic AI</span>, capable of autonomously orchestrating workflows across systems. Bain’s “State of the Art of Agentic AI Transformation” shows that organizations advancing beyond pilots achieved <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">10 %–25 % EBITDA gains</span> by embedding AI into core operations. BCG reports that only ~26 % of companies have crossed the threshold from proof-of-concept to scaling value. McKinsey’s “Superagency in the Workplace” highlights the leadership gap: employees are ready, but few firms are mature in AI deployment. Accenture’s “Built to Scale” research echoes this, noting that only a small fraction of companies successfully scale AI across the enterprise. Deloitte warns that process redesign and governance remain the main barriers to realizing AI’s full value.  
I envision a future—within the next 6 to 12 months—where leadership no longer directs tasks but designs systems: architects of intelligent processes, not operators of fragmented work. Organizations that begin building this capacity now will seize structural advantage.  
I seek to partner in shaping that transformation: co-designing strategy, architecture, governance, and culture so that autonomous systems serve purpose and performance — not the other way around.
