I’m a child of the Internet - I built my first PC at the age of 12. Today, in my 30s a growing consensus among leading consultancies envisions a world driven by <span class="text-accent-light dark:text-accent-dark">Agentic AI</span>, where work shifts from people executing tasks to leaders <span class="text-accent-light dark:text-accent-dark">designing systems</span> that prioritize frictionless and scalable end-to-end execution. Over the next decade, this might extend the winner-takes-most dynamic that is inherent to digital spaces to even more professions and industries as ownership becomes ever more concentrated. I aim to shape that future from within a sector where digital capabilities translate into measurable <span class="text-accent-light dark:text-accent-dark">ROI</span> for my sponsor - and durable career-capital for me.
