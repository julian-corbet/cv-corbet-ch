<ul class="list-disc pl-5">
  <li>
    <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">Trust & Loyalty</span> — I show up, protect the team, and speak plainly. Trust keeps focus on the work (not politics) and lets us take smart risks together.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">Curiosity & Experimentation</span> — I budget <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">at least 20%</span> for learning loops and small bets. Technology opens doors tomorrow we can’t try today; we test, measure, adopt what works.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">Humility & Learning</span> — we assume incomplete knowledge. I invite challenge, share credit, own missteps without blame, and turn insights into faster improvement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">Simplicity & Modularity</span> — prefer simple, composable parts; they’re easier to monitor, repair, and replicate. Let complexity live at the system level—individual pieces stay simple.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">Teamship & Collective Intelligence</span> — the best team answer beats the best solo answer. I facilitate balanced participation, clear roles, and respectful debate so diverse strengths compound.
  </li>
</ul>
