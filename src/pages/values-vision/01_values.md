Connecting with a team that shares my values is essential for me to deliver my best work. In my experience, breaking those principles only ever leads to subpar outcomes (see the science behind it) - and I’ve regretted every single time that happened.

<ul class="list-disc pl-5">
  <li>
    ==Trust & Loyalty== — I show up, protect the team, and speak plainly. Mutual trust enables a team to focus on real work (not politics) and inspires to take smart bets together.
  </li>
  <li>
    ==Curiosity & Experimentation== — I budget ***at least 20%*** for learning loops and experiments. Technology is ever evolving and with it the cost to trap oneself in suboptimal systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    ==Humility & Learning== — we all are human & failable. I invite challenge, share credit, own missteps without blame, and turn insights into faster improvement.
  </li>
  <li>
    ==Simplicity & Modularity== — prefer simple, composable parts; they’re easier to monitor, repair, and replicate. Let complexity live at the system level—individual pieces stay simple.
  </li>
  <li>
    ==Teamship & Collective Intelligence== — the best team answer beats the best solo answer. I facilitate balanced participation, clear roles, and respectful debate so diverse strengths compound.
  </li>
</ul>
