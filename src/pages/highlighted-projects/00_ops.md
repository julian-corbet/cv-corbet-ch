Context: Multi-site scale-up in 2022; core system crashed mid-projects, halting field crews and sales; client’s reputation & further expansion at stake

Result: Preserved reputation and continuity; addressed infra bottlenecks; prevented six- to seven-figure misinvestments; transferred ownership orderly
