Connecting with a team that shares my values is essential for me to deliver my best work. I often begrudgingly had to observe that breaking those principles leads to subpar work outcomes.

- � ==Trust & Loyalty== — I show up and speak politely but plainly. When trust is high, politics drop, and performance rises. <sup>1</sup>  
- 💻 ==Curiosity & Experimentation== — I dedicate ***at least 20 %*** to exploring. Executives that invest in people and learning outperform. <sup>2</sup>  
- 📖 ==Humility & Learning== — We’re all fallible. I invite challenge, own mistakes, and am not afraid to let everyone teach me. I hate pretenders. <sup>3</sup>
- 🧩 ==Simplicity & Modularity== — Simple, composable parts are easier to evolve & change. Robust complexity emerges from combining simple systems. <sup>4</sup>  
- �🦎 ==Teamship & Collective Stewardship== — Great teams always outperform great individuals. As a chameleon I facilitate balanced participation, clear roles, and respectful debate so diverse strengths compound. <sup>5</sup>
