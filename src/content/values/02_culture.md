I want to join a company that refuses silos. Technology isn’t a back-office concern; it’s a shared mandate to **design systems that shape outcomes**. Put capable people close to customers and let cross-functional teams own problems end-to-end—because ==systems are destiny==<sup>1</sup>. The culture I seek treats capability as a compounding asset: ==invest early==, protect teams, and ==let learning happen== in the flow of work<sup>3</sup>. It runs on partnership, not turf—clarity of roles, transparent decisions, and psychological safety to debate, decide, and execute. AI does not “belong” to the IT department; it belongs to *all of us* to co-create resilient platforms that feed the business that feeds us<sup>2</sup>. I do not seek to be promoted over my peers but to belong to the most high-performing team I could ever imagine because it is the people that influence me every day at work that will decide who I will grow up to be.

That’s the culture I want to help build: customer-proximate, cross-functional by default, long-term in its bets - where we measure ourselves by achievements, durable **ROI** and the challenges we overcame.
