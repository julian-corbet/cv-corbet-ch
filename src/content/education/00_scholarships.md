I was selected for ==four prestigious scholarships==. Most importantly, the ==German Academic Scholarship Foundation==, Germany’s most competitive merit award, granted to roughly ==1% of top-performing nominees== for academic excellence and leadership potential. I also received two ==Rolf & Edith Sandvoss Scholarships== (Bachelor & Master), supporting ==high-achieving first-generation physics students== through a combination of merit and social criteria. In addition, I was admitted to the ==e-fellows network==, a competitive ==talent programme== for high-potential students and ==young professionals==, while actively contributing to impactful extracurriculars such as international leadership (AIESEC), social entrepreneurship (Enactus) & student consulting (Green Finance Consulting).
