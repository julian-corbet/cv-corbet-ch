I studied Psychology with a strong interest in ==neuroscience==, ==work & organizational psychology==, and the behavioural dynamics that shape decisions in individuals, teams, and complex systems. My focus was on how ==cognition, incentives, and physiological processes== interact to influence performance, adaptation, and organisational outcomes. This integrated perspective complemented my ==quantitative background== and grounded my work in ==behavioural and organisational analytics==, making it directly relevant to transformation, change, and decision-support contexts. It also shaped my later research in ==AI-driven assessment==, ==cognitive modelling==, and ==technology-enabled interventions==, areas where human behaviour, data, and technology intersect.
