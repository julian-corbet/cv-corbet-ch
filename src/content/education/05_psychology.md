I studied Psychology with a strong interest in biopsychology, neuroscience, and the mechanisms of human intelligence; focusing on how perception, cognition, and decision-making emerge from biological and computational processes. This perspective complemented my quantitative background, anchored my work in behavioural and organisational analytics, and shaped my later research in AI-driven assessment, cognitive modelling, and technology-enabled training systems.
