My studies in Physics focused on ==quantitative modelling==, ==AI & machine learning==, and the experimental foundations of ==complex biological and physical systems==. I became particularly interested in how physical principles can be used to ==measure, model, and predict cognitive and physiological processes==, which led me to a wide range of topics, from applied electronics and biophysics to near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) at the ==neuroscience== interface. I also pursued coursework in game theory and chaotic systems to better understand strategic decision-making and incentive-driven behaviour at the system level. This combination of ==mathematical rigour==, ==AI-driven analysis==, and hands-on ==experimental design== shaped the projects listed below and built the foundation for my later work across AI, engineering, and decision science.
