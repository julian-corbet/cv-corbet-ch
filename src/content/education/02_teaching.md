### Applied Statistics Tutoring

For three years, I served as an ==independent tutor== for applied ==statistics== (==SPSS & R==), supporting thesis writers and advanced undergraduates. This long-term role strengthened my ability to translate complex quantitative methods into accessible, practical skills.

### Mentoring Programme

I co-created a mentoring programme in the Psychology department, ==matching mentors and mentees across cohorts== and supporting skill transfer in academic methods and university navigation. The initiative improved continuity and peer support across year groups ==enlisting all undergraduates==.

### Student Representation

Alongside teaching and mentoring, I engaged in ==student-led university governance== and served on the ==departmental student councils of Physics and Psychology== for several terms, contributing to a range of committee roles.
