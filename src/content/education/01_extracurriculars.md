#### AIESEC

At AIESEC, I co-led the ==Incoming Global Talent== team, driving international placements and corporate collaborations. My core contribution was ==driving a multicultural, high-velocity team== and coordinating cross-border talent processes under tight timelines.

#### Enactus

Within Enactus, I contributed to the ==Enactus X innovation team==, creating ==early-stage social entrepreneurship== opportunities. The team’s portfolio included projects such as employment pathways for homeless individuals and local sustainability initiatives.

#### Green Finance Consulting

At Green Finance Consulting, I contributed to a pro-bono ==collaboration with Roland Berger== and the Big Girls Foundation. My key achievement was ==designing a scalable database system== for thousands of scholarship applications, enabling the growth of girls’ education programmes in Kenya. Additionally, I acted as a BDSU liaison, advocating for & strengthening our connection to Germany’s national student consulting network.

#### Independent Volunteering

Beyond student organisations, I engaged in substantial independent volunteering across tutoring, applied-statistics teaching, suicide prevention, crisis intervention, and harm-reduction work.
