I was selected for the ==fully financed MBA== programme of the ==Collège des Ingénieurs (CDI)==, one of Europe’s most selective management programmes for high potentials with a quantitative and scientific background (==selectivity ~4%==). The programme combines executive-level training with international, high-responsibility assignments in leading European companies, exposing participants to strategic, operational, and technology-driven decision environments. I used my time at CDI to deepen my capabilities in ==AI leadership==, ==capital & people skills==, and ==technology & innovation management==, strengthening my ability to convert analytical insight into business impact.

#### AI Leadership

At CDI, I specialised in AI leadership, including participation in the AI Summer School with Schwarz IT. I led the development of operations-ready GenAI pilots, ensured alignment with EU AI Act governance requirements, and built structured approaches to integrating AI into organisational processes and decision cycles.

#### Capital & People Skills

My training in capital and people skills centred on financial analysis, structured communication, and stakeholder alignment. I evaluated a nearshoring case using rigorous financial modelling and reframed the results through a combined strategy–risk–communication lens, strengthening my ability to influence decisions in complex organisational settings.

#### Technology & Innovation Management

In technology & innovation management, I evaluated ROI, NPV, IRR and assessed market and technology risks across incremental (stage-gate) and disruptive innovation paths. This enhanced my ability to translate technical feasibility into commercial value and long-term strategic positioning.
