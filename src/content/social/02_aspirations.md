Solving challenges within my personal circle and working with others taught me the importance of investing time in initiatives that scale. Real ==change happens where technology and capital meet==, and I believe joining those forces is how I can give my ideas a real chance to matter.

I am fascinated by ==longevity== research, the idea that aging and disease are not fixed conditions but technical problems that can be solved. Extending healthy life through medical innovation could add decades of vitality as we overcome illnesses that have burdened humanity for innumerable generations.

I am equally drawn to ==biohacking==. Humans are no longer shaped by nature yet lack access to their own operating system, which still runs on Stone-Age defaults. Life-science research may (in the future) help us unlock that control, allowing us to adjust our bodies and minds to changing environments like air pollution or the coming climate calamities. Nature forgot to give us root access; now it is time we earn it.

Finally, I care deeply about ==equality==. A long and capable life means little without dignity or opportunity. Reducing poverty and inequality is essential so that everyone can contribute meaningfully to progress and live a life worth telling.

This aspiration is deceptively simple yet remains far from reach. There is still much to build and much worth investing in.
