title: Upbringing

Often I get asked what my CV does not give away about myself. I tend to think that my upbringing is key to understanding what kind of person I am.

While our society thinks of itself as a meritocracy, it really is not. Some inherit a ladder, some are born into a large pit. From the outside my upbringing looked normal, my parents feared the public perception.From the inside it was different. My mother wanted to abort me before birth because I was conceived out of wedlock (kid of the 90s). Yet, through a miracle I survived and my twin brother died and the pregnancy continued. When I was finally born I lacked oxygen, but again I survived - but with slight disabilities for the rest of my life. From this it is easy to see, that my parents were not a happy couple. They had made a mistake and a few decades ago it was unavoidable they would marry. What was avoidable was that they did it twice again and so I grew up with the screams of my siblings (especially my sister) when they were beaten at night.

So, when I grew up my mother had to raise her children alone, money was very tight since she never managed to find work again. So when I entered school, I discovered that I had no stake in the world. There were no holidays or any other events like birthdays in my life and I quickly was othered and bullied by the other kids for this reason. Since my mother also did not have any friends I believed this to be normal and while my upbringing had many faults, I was told from an early age that my only escape hatch would be education. So even though my physical & social growth was stunted at times, out of necessity my mental growth far exceeded that of my peers and in my teens I came to be best student at my school with over 1000 pupils. 

When I graduated I had violated the school rules by taking more courses than students were allowed to take and I probably had spent way more time in school than others. School had less mold than my home which at that time had turned into a hoarder's mess. Without any working role models at home I turned to my teachers for guidance on how to proceed. My teachers & later professors nudged me to try to become a scientist and so I did.
I believe that the world is created in our minds and so I went to learn more about it and started to study Psychology and Physics, in effect neuroscience which was a nascent discipline at that time. While I would go on to write many more papers and theses and imbibe about 10 years of university level studies, the most important lessons I would miss out on. How society works, where the centers of power are and how you get to be one of the people who have the power to effect society. I was blindsided by all that talk about science and progress and I was incredibly naive in my world view.
