One view of my life is to focus on the adversities I experienced; another is to see them as a kind of management school. Without a safety net failure was not an option - especially considering the suicidal crises my siblings went through. I ==learned to act fast, to plan ahead, to steady others== even when I was unsure myself. Over time that urgency became the norm; the reflex to survive became a habit of getting things done and not panic since I could not afford that luxury.

At school, because I was top of the class and despite being shunned, everyone wanted my help on academic matters. I quickly understood the value it had for others and first helped out in my class, later in my grade, and soon was a home tutor for classes I had already passed AND for classes I was yet to take. It was one of the few ways I could earn money. But not everyone could afford my then-modest hourly rate, and that made me realise that even though my own situation was far from ideal, I still had something I could give - and that giving it mattered. So while at university I continued my efforts to save single students as time permitted and additionally for three years ==co-led a voluntary program teaching applied statistics== to students preparing their theses. I never stopped ==sharing knowledge== and my latest significant project (2023) was a pro bono engagement supporting ==Roland Berger and the Big Girls Foundation in Kenya==, where I designed a database architecture to help the organisation manage thousands of scholarship applications and expand educational access for girls in underserved regions. This way my initial discovery that ==knowledge is power== now even touches the life of people on another continent.

Through my studies in Psychology, I became qualified to ==work in suicide prevention== and substance-abuse crises. Beyond my family background, the topic first surfaced at school when classmates I knew personally were affected, prompting me to look for solutions — to understand why people lose balance and, later, with the tools of my training, to step in and break the cycle. During my studies, I took my first practical step by joining my then-girlfriend in volunteering for Kids Hotline, one of Germany’s first digital counselling platforms for minors. We supported teenagers facing identity issues, body concerns, and self-doubt. As one of the few male voices, I gained early insight into the quiet pressures shaping young men and women — patterns that, more than a decade later, I still recognise in peers and teams I work with today. Later, I professionalised and worked in multiple clinical and outreach environments supporting therapy, rehabilitation, and education for people facing addiction and relapse. Those experiences reinforced my ability to ==stay composed under pressure==, to read the room quickly, and to ==restore order== when stability is fleeting. When legalization reshaped Germany’s drug policy in 2024, I joined Basis e. V. Frankfurt to support harm-reduction and education programmes focused on prevention over punishment. If I had to name my central insight, it would be this: humans can endure almost anything if the “why” is convincing - but without meaning, life becomes unbearable. It’s a lesson that applies equally to people, teams, and business strategies.

And it brings me back to my own childhood that I miraculously managed to escape. A lot of people are not so lucky.
