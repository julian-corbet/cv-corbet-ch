I’ve learned that influence grows from ==doing, reflecting, and sharing==. Building on my experiences in **technology**, **corporates**, and **freelancing**, I focus on turning practice into perspective — translating hands-on work into stories, frameworks, and takeaways others can build on. My goal is to connect the *how* of technology and computer systems with the *why* of leadership and human systems (organizations).

I’m building a **blog and media presence** similar to *Substack* — combining human writing, interviews, and dialogue with AI to explore how technology reshapes organizations. Having already produced **audio formats for others**, I continuously refine my recording and editing capabilities to achieve professional quality, which recently led me to provide **AV operations at the Swiss Python Summit**. **Podcasting and long-form interviews** are the natural next layer: they extend my curiosity beyond systems into the people who design them.
