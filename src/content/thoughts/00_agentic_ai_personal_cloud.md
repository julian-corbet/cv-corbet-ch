Understanding requires touch. I believe you can’t truly grasp software until you’ve built or broken it yourself. ==Doing sharpens intuition== in a way no theory can. Creating something tangible also attracts feedback — and feedback accelerates learning faster than any course or certification ever could.

In my homelab, I operate a full stack of self-hosted & cloud-based apps — from CRM and AI workbenches to automation pipelines — infrastructure that would cost a four-figure sum per month commercially, but runs for electricity cost on my own systems. This lab isn’t just for me: about a dozen others rely on it sparking creating another business from my passion projects. Besides it’s my way to test Open Source tools, explore ==digital sovereignty==, and ==validate ideas== before I ever recommend them professionally — going from 0 to 1 in private, and scaling at work. This way every employer benefits from countless lessons on my own dime.
