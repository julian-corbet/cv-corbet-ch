**Current Status**: Experimenting with autonomous AI agents in personal cloud environments.

In my homelab, I'm exploring how AI agents can self-manage cloud infrastructure, handle routine tasks, and even contribute to open source projects. This involves setting up agent workflows that can interpret natural language requests, execute infrastructure as code, and provide intelligent monitoring.

The goal is to understand how to design agentic systems that are reliable, secure, and contextually aware - paving the way for more advanced automation in enterprise settings through hands-on learning and community collaboration.
