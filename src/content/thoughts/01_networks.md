Ideas grow faster in conversation. I learn best through exchange — by engaging with practitioners who see the world from different angles.

In business, I’m connected across consulting and finance communities: **Bain Spark**, **BCG Emeralds**, and alumni networks like **BDSU**, **AIESEC**, and **Enactus** keep me close to peers in strategy and operations. Through **SECA (Young Member)** and Swiss **private-equity**, **venture**, and **corporate-development** circles, I stay aligned with the evolving landscape and business opportunities. On the tech side, I collaborate with developer and digital-rights communities — from **CCC** and **Linux User Groups** to **DigiGes**, **digitalswitzerland**, and **Impact Hub**. I regularly join **Agile Breakfasts** and online DACH meetups, where engineers and designers discuss open tools and responsible innovation.  

These circles keep me ==honest, curious, and updated==. They make sure that what I build or recommend isn’t shaped by echo chambers but by people who challenge my assumptions early.
