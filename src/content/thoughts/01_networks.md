**Current Status**: Deep diving into modern network architectures and zero-trust security principles.

My homelab serves as a testing ground for implementing various network topologies - from traditional hierarchical designs to software-defined networking (SDN) approaches. I'm particularly focused on zero-trust networking, where no device or user is inherently trusted, and all network traffic is continuously validated.

Community discussions around these implementations have been invaluable, helping refine my understanding of how these concepts translate to enterprise environments. This hands-on experience is crucial for evaluating security technologies and understanding their operational impact.
