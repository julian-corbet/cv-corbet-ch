==Excellence== proven by ==four scholarships==, ==three university degrees==, experience in ==two global corporations==, and building ==one software startup==. My background spans ==M&A (Covendit, Corporate Finance)==, ==Management Consulting (Nexgen, Enterprise IT)==, ==PMO (Swisscom, Cloud & AI)==, and ==Machine Learning (Airbus, Defense)==, giving me cross-domain perspective to translate across silos, align stakeholders and lead diverse teams & projects.

Known for ==intellectual velocity & first-principles problem solving==, I isolate root causes & pioneer innovative, tech-enabled solutions. Shifting the frame from ==complexity to clarity==, I facilitate smart capital allocation & aspire to build a durable career in a ==forward-thinking firm== that prizes curiosity & execution; growing as a leader while compounding ==financial engineering & management skills== (==MBA==, ==CFI==, ==AI== – ops, cloud & specialized).

==Technological change== is ==permanent and unavoidable==. The right timing is key to success; else underutilization, painful change cycles, and missed opportunities in products, profit & growth loom. I have an ==ambitious vision==: As a ==force multiplier== teams I join surface high-impact tools & employ productivity innovations; I get domain depth. Together we ==scale what works==, deliver ==ROI== & ==compound value==; empowering an ==improving organization== that wins.
