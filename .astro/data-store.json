I tend to think that my upbringing is key to understanding who I am.\n\nWe are all born innocent, but not all of us are born equal.\n\n\u003Cfooter>— \u003Ccite>Nelson Mandela\u003C/cite>\u003C/footer>\n\nWhile our society likes to think of itself as a meritocracy, it is not. Some inherit a ladder; others are born into a pit. My parents did everything they could to avoid a negative public perception. However, from the inside it was different. Before I was born, my mother had wanted to abort me because I was conceived out of wedlock (a \"child of the 90s\"). Yet, through a miracle, my twin brother died in the womb and the pregnancy continued with me. When I was finally born, I lacked oxygen, but again I survived, albeit with slight disabilities that took decades to overcome.\n\nMy parents were not a happy couple. They had made a mistake, and a few decades ago it was still unavoidable that they would marry. What was avoidable was that they did it twice more, and so I grew up with the screams of my siblings (especially my sister) when they were beaten at night. Money was always tight, as my mother never found work again. When I entered school, I discovered that this meant I had no stake in the world. There were no vacations or birthdays in my life, and I was quickly othered and bullied by the other kids for this reason. Since my family also had no friends, I believed this to be the normal state of affairs and grew up very isolated and detached from my peers.\n\nWhile my upbringing may have had many faults, I was told from an early age that my only escape hatch would be education. So even though my physical and social growth was stunted at times, out of necessity my mental growth far exceeded that of my peers. This led me to become the best student among a cohort of several hundred. My teachers encouraged me to enter mathematics and science competitions, and for the first time in my life, I thrived. As my family’s home turned into a moldy hoarder’s mess, I spent far more time at school than most students. When I graduated, I had even violated school rules by taking more courses than were allowed.\n\nWithout any working role models at home, I turned to my teachers for guidance on how to proceed. They and later my professors nudged me toward becoming a scientist, and so I successfully studied Psychology and later Physics, aiming for a career in the then-nascent field of neuroscience. Yet at home, in my 20s, crisis after crisis struck. My maternal grandparents, who had sometimes supported my mother financially, fell ill.

Some inherit a ladder; others are born into a pit. My parents did everything they could to avoid a negative public perception. However, from the inside it was different. Before I was born, my mother had wanted to abort me because I was conceived out of wedlock (a “child of the 90s”). Yet, through a miracle, my twin brother died in the womb and the pregnancy continued with me. When I was finally born, I lacked oxygen, but again I survived, albeit with slight disabilities that took decades to overcome.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My parents were not a happy couple. They had made a mistake, and a few decades ago it was still unavoidable that they would marry. What was avoidable was that they did it twice more, and so I grew up with the screams of my siblings (especially my sister) when they were beaten at night. Money was always tight, as my mother never found work again. When I entered school, I discovered that this meant I had no stake in the world. There were no vacations or birthdays in my life, and I was quickly othered and bullied by the other kids for this reason. Since my family also had no friends, I believed this to be the normal state of affairs and grew up very isolated and detached from my peers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While my upbringing may have had many faults, I was told from an early age that my only escape hatch would be education. So even though my physical and social growth was stunted at times, out of necessity my mental growth far exceeded that of my peers. This led me to become the best student among a cohort of several hundred. My teachers encouraged me to enter mathematics and science competitions, and for the first time in my life, I thrived. As my family’s home turned into a moldy hoarder’s mess, I spent far more time at school than most students. When I graduated, I had even violated school rules by taking more courses than were allowed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Without any working role models at home, I turned to my teachers for guidance on how to proceed.
