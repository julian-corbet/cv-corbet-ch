I soon branched out to other students and explored subjects I studied solely to teach them. Meeting students with neither money nor skills forced me to decide whether I would share my newfound wealth of knwoledge without compensation and of course I did.  During university, I continued supporting individual students while co-leading a voluntary program ==teaching applied statistics== to thesis writers for three years.  Later, I carried the same spirit further: in 2023, I joined Green Finance Consulting for a ==pro bono collaboration with Roland Berger== and the Big Girls Foundation in Kenya. There, I designed a database architecture to manage thousands of scholarship applications to expand educational access for girls in underserved regions. This way my initial discovery that ==knowledge is power== now even touches the life of people on another continent.\n\nThrough my studies in Psychology, I became qualified to ==work in suicide prevention== and substance-abuse crises. Beyond my family background, the topic first surfaced at school when classmates I knew personally were affected, prompting me to look for solutions — to understand why people lose balance and, later, with the tools of my training, to step in and break the cycle. During my studies, I took my first practical step by joining my then-girlfriend in volunteering for Kids Hotline, one of Germany’s first digital counselling platforms for minors. We supported teenagers facing identity issues, body concerns, and self-doubt. As one of the few male voices, I gained early insight into the quiet pressures shaping young men and women - patterns that, more than a decade later, I still recognise in peers and teams I work with today. Later, I professionalised and worked in multiple clinical and outreach environments supporting therapy, rehabilitation, and education for people facing addiction and relapse. Those experiences reinforced my ability to ==stay composed under pressure==, to read the room quickly, and to ==restore order== when stability is fleeting. When legalization reshaped Germany’s drug policy in 2024, I joined Basis e. V. Frankfurt to support harm-reduction and education programmes focused on prevention over punishment.\n\nAt AIESEC, I co-led the Incoming Global Talent Team in connecting young professionals with placements in leading European companies. With Enactus, I focused on social entrepreneurship, joining the Enactus X team - modelled after Google’s - to develop business concepts with measurable social value. One Enactus project I’m particularly proud of created employment for homeless people as city guides in Frankfurt, restoring both income and dignity, while others advanced food-saving and local sustainability. Later, with Green Finance Consulting, I explored how consulting and organisational design can align incentives, impact, and human motivation which led to the collaboration with Roland Berger and the Big Girls Foundation to expand educational access in Kenya. \n\nIf I had to name my central insight from all my volunteering experiences, it would be this: humans can endure almost anything if the “why” is convincing - but ==without purpose, life becomes unbearable==. It’s a lesson that ==applies equally to people, teams, and businesses==. I found my purpose when education offered an escape from poverty and new doors began to open, and I feel honoured to have walked beside others for a while, guiding and protecting them on their path.","src/content/social/01_impact.md","00ce5071353204e9",{"html":641,"metadata":642},"\u003Cp>One view of my life is to focus on the adversities I experienced; another is to see them as a kind of management school.

Later, I carried the same spirit further: in 2023, I joined Green Finance Consulting for a \u003Cmark class=\"md-hl\">pro bono collaboration with Roland Berger\u003C/mark> and the Big Girls Foundation in Kenya. There, I designed a database architecture to manage thousands of scholarship applications to expand educational access for girls in underserved regions. This way my initial discovery that \u003Cmark class=\"md-hl\">knowledge is power\u003C/mark> now even touches the life of people on another continent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Through my studies in Psychology, I became qualified to \u003Cmark class=\"md-hl\">work in suicide prevention\u003C/mark> and substance-abuse crises. Beyond my family background, the topic first surfaced at school when classmates I knew personally were affected, prompting me to look for solutions — to understand why people lose balance and, later, with the tools of my training, to step in and break the cycle. During my studies, I took my first practical step by joining my then-girlfriend in volunteering for Kids Hotline, one of Germany’s first digital counselling platforms for minors. We supported teenagers facing identity issues, body concerns, and self-doubt. As one of the few male voices, I gained early insight into the quiet pressures shaping young men and women - patterns that, more than a decade later, I still recognise in peers and teams I work with today. Later, I professionalised and worked in multiple clinical and outreach environments supporting therapy, rehabilitation, and education for people facing addiction and relapse. Those experiences reinforced my ability to \u003Cmark class=\"md-hl\">stay composed under pressure\u003C/mark>, to read the room quickly, and to \u003Cmark class=\"md-hl\">restore order\u003C/mark> when stability is fleeting. When legalization reshaped Germany’s drug policy in 2024, I joined Basis e. V. Frankfurt to support harm-reduction and education programmes focused on prevention over punishment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At AIESEC, I co-led the Incoming Global Talent Team in connecting young professionals with placements in leading European companies. With Enactus, I focused on social entrepreneurship, joining the Enactus X team - modelled after Google’s - to develop business concepts with measurable social value. One Enactus project I’m particularly proud of created employment for homeless people as city guides in Frankfurt, restoring both income and dignity, while others advanced food-saving and local sustainability. Later, with Green Finance Consulting, I explored how consulting and organisational design can align incentives, impact, and human motivation which led to the collaboration with Roland Berger and the Big Girls Foundation to expand educational access in Kenya.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If I had to name my central insight from all my volunteering experiences, it would be this: humans can endure almost anything if the “why” is convincing - but \u003Cmark class=\"md-hl\">without purpose, life becomes unbearable\u003C/mark>. It’s a lesson that \u003Cmark class=\"md-hl\">applies equally to people, teams, and businesses\u003C/mark>.
