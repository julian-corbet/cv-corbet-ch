In my experience, breaking those principles only ever leads to subpar outcomes (see the science behind it) - and I’ve regretted every single time that happened.</p><ul><li><mark class=md-hl>Trust &#x26; Loyalty</mark> — I show up, protect the team, and speak plainly. Mutual trust enables a team to focus on real work (not politics) and inspires to take smart bets together.</li><li><mark class=md-hl>Curiosity &#x26; Experimentation</mark> — I budget <em><strong>at least 20%</strong></em> for learning loops and experiments. Technology is ever evolving and with it the cost to trap oneself in suboptimal systems.</li><li><mark class=md-hl>Humility &#x26; Learning</mark> — we all are human &#x26; failable. I invite challenge, share credit, own missteps without blame, and turn insights into faster improvement.</li><li><mark class=md-hl>Simplicity &#x26; Modularity</mark> — prefer simple, composable parts; they’re easier to monitor, repair, and replicate. Let complexity live at the system level—individual pieces stay simple.</li><li><mark class=md-hl>Teamship &#x26; Collective Intelligence</mark> — the best team answer beats the best solo answer. I facilitate balanced participation, clear roles, and respectful debate so diverse strengths compound.</li></ul><small><strong>Sources</strong><br>• Psychological safety &#x26; team effectiveness — Google re:Work / Project Aristotle.<br>• “20% time” as an innovation mechanism — Harvard Business Review coverage.<br>• Explore vs. exploit in organizational learning — March (1991), Organization Science.<br>• Simplicity as a prerequisite for reliability — Google SRE book.<br>• Collective intelligence drivers (social sensitivity, balanced turn-taking) — Woolley et al., Science (2010).</small>
