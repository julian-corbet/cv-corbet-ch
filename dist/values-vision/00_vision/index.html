Today, in my 30s a growing consensus among leading consultancies envisions a world driven by <em><strong>Agentic AI</strong></em>, where work shifts from people executing tasks to leaders <em><strong>designing systems</strong></em> that prioritize frictionless and scalable end-to-end execution. Over the next decade, this might extend the winner-takes-most dynamic that is inherent to digital spaces to even more professions and industries as ownership becomes ever more concentrated. I aim to shape that future from within a sector where digital capabilities translate into measurable <em><strong>ROI</strong></em> for my sponsor - and durable career-capital for me.</p><hr><p>Sources:</p><ul><li>Accenture, <em>“AI: Built to Scale”</em> (<a href="https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/a-com-migration/thought-leadership-assets/accenture-built-to-scale-pdf-report.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">accenture.com</a>)</li><li>Bain, <em>“State of the Art of Agentic AI Transformation”</em> (<a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/state-of-the-art-of-agentic-ai-transformation-technology-report-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">bain.com</a>)</li><li>BCG, <em>“Are You Generating Value from AI?
